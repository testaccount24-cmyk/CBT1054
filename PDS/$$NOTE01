I'm attaching a file that may be useful.  We are converting
users to use a pass phrase instead of a password.  We were
looking for a way to capture what user ids are using phrases,
which ones that are using passwords.  This information is in SMF
records but there was not a report set up as there are for other
RACF reports.  This contains a sample report that can be
submitted.  The other issue is that the default for SMF is to
not capture some of the data needed.  That meant that we had to
make some adjustments to the RACF class APPL to generate the SMF
records we needed.  Maybe this will help someone else as
security at our shop is being really being cranked up as it
likely is at other shops.

Have a great day.
