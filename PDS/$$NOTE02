I tried to really stress to folks in this doc that the information
for VPS is only needed in a rare instance.  They use VPS and they
access VPS/VMCF as a VTAM application.  Most LRS shops access
VPS/VMCF as a TSO ISPF application.

For the report member it is used to track via SMF password and or
phrase logon usage.  It is a supplement to the normal reports
IBM provides in their samplib.

You can always determine who has the capability to use a password
and or a passphrase.  You can have one, both or none.  None
indicates a protect userid that cannot be used to logon.

Let me know if this makes sense.
