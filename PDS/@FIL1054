//***FILE1054 is from Paul Lemons and contains a way of determining *   FILE1054
//*           whether a TSO user is using a password or a pass-     *   FILE1054
//*           phrase.  His installation is switching all their      *   FILE1054
//*           TSO users from passwords to passphrases, and they     *   FILE1054
//*           want to be able to monitor whether a TSO user has     *   FILE1054
//*           switched to passphrases, or they are still using      *   FILE1054
//*           passwords.                                            *   FILE1054
